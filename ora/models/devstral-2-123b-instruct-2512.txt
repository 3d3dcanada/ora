Our AI models are designed and/or optimized to run on NVIDIA GPU-accelerated systems. By leveraging NVIDIA's hardware (e.g. GPU cores) and software frameworks (e.g., CUDA libraries), the model achieves faster training and inference times compared to CPU-only solutions.

Software Integration:
Runtime Engines:

vLLM: >= 0.12.0
mistral-common: >= 1.8.6
Supported Hardware:

NVIDIA Ampere: A100
NVIDIA Blackwell: B200, B100, GB200
NVIDIA Hopper: H100, H200
Operating Systems: Linux

The integration of foundation and fine-tuned models into AI systems requires additional testing using use-case-specific data to ensure safe and effective deployment. Following the V-model methodology, iterative testing and validation at both unit and system levels are essential to mitigate risks, meet technical and functional requirements, and ensure compliance with safety and ethical standards before deployment.
