Step 3.5 Flash
Description
Step 3.5 Flash is a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model developed by StepFun, engineered to deliver frontier reasoning and agentic capabilities with exceptional efficiency. Built on 196.81B total parameters with only ~11B active per token, it achieves the reasoning depth of top-tier models while maintaining real-time responsiveness with 100-300 tok/s throughput (peaking at 350 tok/s for coding tasks).

This model is ready for commercial/non-commercial use.

Known Limitations
Token Efficiency. Step 3.5 Flash achieves frontier-level agentic intelligence but currently relies on longer generation trajectories than Gemini 3.0 Pro to reach comparable quality.
Efficient Universal Mastery. We aim to unify generalist versatility with deep domain expertise. To achieve this efficiently, we are advancing variants of on-policy distillation, allowing the model to internalize expert behaviors with higher sample efficiency.
RL for More Agentic Tasks. While Step 3.5 Flash demonstrates competitive performance on academic agentic benchmarks, the next frontier of agentic AI necessitates the application of RL to intricate, expert-level tasks found in professional work, engineering, and research.
Operational Scope and Constraints. Step 3.5 Flash is tailored for coding and work-centric tasks, but may experience reduced stability during distribution shifts. This typically occurs in highly specialized domains or long-horizon, multi-turn dialogues, where the model may exhibit repetitive reasoning, mixed-language outputs, or inconsistencies in time and identity awareness.
