Our AI models are designed and/or optimized to run on NVIDIA GPU-accelerated systems. By leveraging NVIDIA's hardware (e.g. GPU cores) and software frameworks (e.g., CUDA libraries), the model achieves faster training and inference times compared to CPU-only solutions.

Software Integration:
Runtime Engines:

vLLM: Latest version (recommended, install from nightly wheels)
Transformers: Not yet available (community contribution welcome)
Supported Hardware:

NVIDIA Ampere: A100 (single node, NVFP4)
NVIDIA Blackwell: B200 (single node, FP8)
NVIDIA Hopper: H100 (single node, NVFP4), H200 (single node, FP8)
Operating Systems: Linux

Additional Testing Statement: The integration of foundation and fine-tuned models into AI systems requires additional testing using use-case-specific data to ensure safe and effective deployment. Following the V-model methodology, iterative testing and validation at both unit and system levels are essential to mitigate risks, meet technical and functional requirements, and ensure compliance with safety and ethical standards before deployment.

Inference

Test Hardware: Deployable on-premises on a single node using FP8 quantization (NVIDIA B200, H200) or NVFP4 quantization (NVIDIA H100, A100). Full BF16 deployment requires multi-node configuration.

Additional Details
Known Limitations
Not a dedicated reasoning model: Dedicated reasoning models can outperform Mistral Large 3 in strict reasoning use cases.
Behind vision-first models in multimodal tasks: Mistral Large 3 can lag behind models optimized specifically for vision tasks and use cases.
Complex deployment: Due to its large size (675B parameters) and architecture, the model can be challenging to deploy efficiently with constrained resources or at scale.
Recommended Deployment Settings
Mistral recommends deploying Large 3 in a client-server configuration with the following best practices:

System Prompt: Define a clear environment and use case, including guidance on how to effectively leverage tools in agentic systems.
Sampling Parameters: Use a temperature below 0.1 for daily-driver and production environments. Higher temperatures may be explored for creative use cases - developers are encouraged to experiment with alternative settings.
Tools: Keep the set of tools well-defined and limit their number to the minimum required for the use case. Avoid overloading the model with an excessive number of tools.
Vision: When deploying with vision capabilities, maintain an aspect ratio close to 1:1 (width-to-height) for images. Avoid the use of overly thin or wide images - crop them as needed to ensure optimal performance.
Deployment Options
The model supports two quantization formats for single-node deployment:

FP8 Quantization: Optimized for NVIDIA B200 and H200 GPUs. Delivers maximum throughput for production workloads with full 256k context window support. The Mistral Large 3 Instruct FP8 format can be used on one 8xH200 node. We recommend to use this format if you plan to fine-tuning as it can be more precise than NVFP4 in some situations.
NVFP4 Quantization: Enables deployment on NVIDIA H100 and A100 GPUs. Provides efficient inference with reduced memory footprint on more widely available architectures.
Usage
The model can be used with the following frameworks:

vllm (recommended): See vLLM section below
NOTE
We sadly didn't have enough time to add Mistral Large 3 to transformers, but we would be very happy for a community contribution by opening a PR to huggingface/transformers.

Note 1: We recommend using a relatively low temperature, such as temperature=0.15.

Note 2: Make sure to add a system prompt to the model to best tailor it to your needs. If you want to use the model as a general assistant, we recommend to use the one provided in the SYSTEM_PROMPT.txt file.

vLLM (recommended)
We recommend using this model with vLLM.

Installation

Make sure to install the most recent vLLM:

Bash

Copy
uv pip install -U vllm \
    --torch-backend=auto \
    --extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/nightly
Doing so should automatically install mistral_common >= 1.8.6.

To check:

Bash

Copy
python -c "import mistral_common; print(mistral_common.__version__)"
You can also make use of a ready-to-go docker image or on the docker hub.

Serve

We recommend that you use Mistral Large 3 675B in a server/client setting.

Spin up a server (FP8 quantization for single-node B200/H200 deployment):
Simple

A simple launch command is:

Bash

Copy
vllm serve mistralai/Mistral-Large-3-675B-Instruct-2512 \
  --tensor-parallel-size 8 \
  --tokenizer_mode mistral --config_format mistral --load_format mistral \
  --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser mistral
Key parameter notes:

enable-auto-tool-choice: Required when enabling tool usage.
tool-call-parser mistral: Required when enabling tool usage.
Additional flags:

You can set --max-model-len to preserve memory. By default it is set to 262144 which is quite large but not necessary for most scenarios.
You can set --max-num-batched-tokens to balance throughput and latency, higher means higher throughput but higher latency.
Accelerated with speculative decoding

For maximum performance we recommend serving the checkpoint with its customized draft model Mistral-Large-3-675B-Instruct-2512-Eagle:

Bash

Copy
vllm serve mistralai/Mistral-Large-3-675B-Instruct-2512 \
  --tensor-parallel-size 8 \
  --load-format mistral \
  --tokenizer-mode mistral \
  --config-format mistral \
  --enable-auto-tool-choice \
  --tool-call-parser mistral \
  --limit-mm-per-prompt '{"image": 10}' \
  --speculative_config '{
    "model": "mistralai/Mistral-Large-3-675B-Instruct-2512-Eagle",
    "num_speculative_tokens": 3,
    "method": "eagle",
    "max_model_len": "16384"
  }'
For more information on the draft model, please have a look at Mistral-Large-3-675B-Instruct-2512-Eagle.

Note: Mistral Large 3 675B is optimized for single-node deployment using FP8 quantization (NVIDIA B200, H200) or NVFP4 quantization (NVIDIA H100, A100). Full BF16 requires multi-node setup.
